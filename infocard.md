## About

I am a React/Frontend developer with more than 5 years of professional experience. At Sparq, I worked from January 2019 through October 2024, where I collaborated with Sparq and client colleagues. This collaboration spanned project managers, stakeholders, QA/QC, and many frontend and backend colleagues. During my time at Sparq, I was also promoted from Associate Web Developer to Web Developer.

Since my position at Sparq ended in October 2024, I have made a focused effort to learn as much as possible to become a fullstack web developer while looking for my next role. In doing so, I have picked up the following skills at an elementary level:

- Next.js
- Redux Toolkit
- RTK Query
- Appwrite\.io

I have used these skills in my side projects as well. In addition, I am learning Node.js on Udemy and recently attended the [OKCoders Pro](https://www.techlahoma.org/ok-coders/) Python Bootcamp, which was held in November/December of 2025. For more details about my projects, learning, or my background/qualifications, please visit my [website](https://coderaj7470.github.io/portfolio/).

I am open to work and would greatly appreciate the opportunity to talk more about my background and qualifications.
